基于nodejs编写的长得像闹钟的铃声系统
An alarm clock written by nodejs .

run this program you should have nodejs and mplayer

than run

```
# npm run set    // download something it will need
```

and

```
# npm start
```

then visit http://localhost:8000/



you can reset it by

```
# npm run clean
```

The music is written by me with Musescore2.And it's a bit frightening.
